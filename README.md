Parts:
Streacom F1CWS Chassis - Black

Intel Core i7-7700 Kaby Lake Quad-Core 3.6 GHz LGA 1151 65W

CRYORIG C7 - 47mm Tall, SFF Mini ITX CPU Heatsink
 - https://www.newegg.com/p/13C-000U-00007?Item=9SIA4UF39D5213
 - Its a little old now, for new builds I might recommend CRYORIG C1 https://www.newegg.com/p/13C-000U-00003
 - Tests indicate it cools better https://www.funkykit.com/reviews/cooling/cryorig-c1-low-profile-cpu-cooler-review/3/
 - Caveat is the size, haven't used it but is bigger (L144.5 mm x W140 mm x H74 mm) vs C7(L97 mm x W97 mm x H47 mm). Limiting factors are the case and size of ram.
